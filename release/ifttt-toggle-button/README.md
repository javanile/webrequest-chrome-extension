<h1>Webrequest.cc Chrome Extensions</h1>

<b>Custom Button</b> is a simple Chrome extension where you can customize a button, set an URL, change the icon and some other stuff.

Just go to options and set the url and the window mode on activation.
You can also set a regular expression to match a certain domain and activate notifications when the match fails.

<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>URL</h3>
Set the url you want to launch. For example:<br>
*http://digg.com/reader*

Add **%url** anywhere in the string and it will be replaced by the active tab url. For example:<br>
*http://www.sciweavers.org/iWeb2Shot?url=%url*

Choose the opening mode:
- **Current tab**: opens in the active tab.
- **New tab**: creates a new tab.
- **New window**: creates a new Chrome window.
- **Popup window**: create a new window but in a popup style, no toolbar, no tab bar, just window border and content.
- **Popup on button**: tries to open the site in a popup. Due to browser security policies, some sites won't load in the button popup. For example Google sites and Facebook won't load.

For example, you could set the url to *chrome://extensions* and then set it to open on a popup window. This way your button will open the extensions page on a separate popup window, pretty cool!

<h3>ICON</h3>
Sets the icon on the button and notifications.<br>
JPG/PNG/ICO format and 19x19px is recommended or it will be resized (but try other dimensions anyway, it may look fine).<br>
*Maximum size of 100KB.*

<h3>DOMAIN</h3>
You can make the button work only on a certain domain.<br>
Matches any url by default.<br>
Uses *regular expressions* (test it here if you want).<br>
For example, this will match any *http/https* site: **^(http|https)://*** 

<h3>NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
Shows desktop notification when domain doesn't match. When active it's possible to change the title and text for the notification.
